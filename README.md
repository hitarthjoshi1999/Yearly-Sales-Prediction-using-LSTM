# Yearly-Sales-Prediction-using-LSTM
It is a part of my course and i have created this git repository where i will improve the current accuracy and try new things on it


I have created a segment in which the loss is plotted w.r.t number of neuron in the model as we can see as the neurons are increasing the slope is gradually decreasing but there is noise the slope because of the random initial weights and also the data is not big enough to clearly see significant change in the slope but we can see a trend in the loss with neuron

One more thing i noticed was that the processing time per epoch also increased when number of neurons were too high
